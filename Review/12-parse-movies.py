To source data for data science projects, you’ll often rely on SQL and NoSQL databases, APIs, or
ready-made CSV data sets.

The problem is that you can’t always find a data set on your topic, databases are not kept current
and APIs are either expensive or have usage limits.

If the data you’re looking for is on an web page, however, then the solution to all these problems is web scraping.

In this tutorial we’ll learn to scrape multiple web pages with Python using BeautifulSoup and requests.
We’ll then perform some simple analysis using pandas, and matplotlib.

You should already have some basic understanding of HTML, a good grasp of Python’s basics, and a rough
idea about what web scraping is. If you are not comfortable with these, I recommend this beginner web scraping tutorial
