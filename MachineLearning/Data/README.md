### [Credit Card Defaults](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients#)

This research aimed at the case of customers‚Äô default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of 
probability of default among six data mining methods. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive 
accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not 
credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel Sorting Smoothing 
Method to estimate the real probability of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and 
the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows 
that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression 
intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one. Therefore, among the six data mining techniques, 
artificial neural network is the only one that can accurately estimate the real probability of default.


### [Real Estate Valuation](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set)

The market historical data set of real estate valuation are collected from Sindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan. The real 
estate valuationù is a regression problem. The data set was randomly split into the training data set (2/3 samples) and 
the testing data set (1/3 samples).


### [Travel Reviews (Google Reviews)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Travel+Reviews)

This data set is populated by crawling TripAdvisor.com. Reviews on destinations in 10 categories mentioned 
across East Asia are considered. Each traveler rating is mapped as Excellent (4), Very Good (3), Average (2), 
Poor (1), and Terrible (0) and average rating is used against each category per user.

### [Facebook Likes](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+metrics)

The data is related to posts' published during the year of 2014 on the Facebook's page of a renowned cosmetics brand. 
This dataset contains 500 of the 790 rows and part of the features analyzed by Moro et al. (2016). The remaining were 
omitted due to confidentiality issues.It includes 7 features known prior to post publication and 12 features for evaluating 
post impact.
