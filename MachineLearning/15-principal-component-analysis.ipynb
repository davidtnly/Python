    "Principal component analysis is an unsupervised algorithm that attempts to detect the relationship between variables and identify patterns in the data such as X and y features. PCA looks to find a low-dimensional representation of the observa-tions that explain a good fraction of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a strong correlation between variables exists, PCA attempt to reduce the dimensionality (size) only makes sense. It's about finding the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data and project it onto a smaller dimensional subspace while retaining most of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, PCA is fundamentally a __dimensionality reduction algorithm__ that projects the entire dataset onto a different feature subspace, but it can also be used for other purposes like visualization, noise filtering, and feature extraction and engineering to name some.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal\n",
    "Reduce the dimensions of a d-dimensional dataset by projecting it onto a (k)-dimensional subspace (where k<d) in order to increase the computational efficiency while retaining important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How is k determined?\n",
    "Compute __eigenvectors__ which are the principal components of a dataset and collect them into a matrix. Each of those eigenvectors is associated with an __eigenvalue__ which can be interpreted as the 'length' or 'magnitude' of the corresponding eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PCA Approach\n",
    "- Standardize the data so every features are measured equally\n",
    "- Compute eigenvetors and eigenvalues pairs from the covariance/correlation matrix or perform singular vector decomposition\n",
    "- Sort eigenvalues in descending order and choose the _k_ eigenvectors that correspond to the _k_ largest eigenvalues where _k_ is the number of dimensions of the new features subspace (k<=d)\n",
    "- Construct the projection matrix _W_ from the selected _k_ eigenvectors\n",
    "- Transform the original dataset _X_ via _W_ to obtain a _k_-dimensional subspace Y\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weakness\n",
    "PCA's main weakness is that it tends to be highly affected by outliers in the data. Scikit-Learn contains a couple interesting variants on PCA, including RandomizedPCA and SparsePCA, both also in the sklearn.decomposition submodule. "

    "### More Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intro\n",
    "Now that we have loaded the same dataset, we will find a lower-dimensional representation of the data of the n obsevations as much as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Idea\n",
    "The idea is that each of the n observations lives in a p-dimensional space, but now all of these dimensions are equally interesting (hence lowering dimensionality). Each of the dimensions found by PCA is a _linear combination_ of the _p_ features or principal components and we can take these linear combinations of the measurements and reduce the number of plots necessary for visual analysis while retaining most of the information present in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scaling\n",
    "Before applying PCA, the features should be centered to have mean zero. The results obtained when PCA is performed will also depend on whether the variables have been individually scaled. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, scaling is important because if performed on unscaled features then the first principal component vector will have a very large loading since that specific feature has the highest variance. So we typically want to scale each variable to have a standard deviation of one before we perform PCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variance\n",
    "The eigenvalues in PCA tell you how much variance can be explained by its associated eigenvector. For example, if 5 out of 10 vectors will have 99% explainability then most likely the number of components used will be 5. Therefore, the highest eigenvalue indicates the highest variance in the data was observed in the direction of its eigenvector. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, if you take all eigenvectors together, you can explain all the variance in the data sample. \n",
    "- PVE = Proportion of Variance Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How many principal components to use?\n",
    "The main point of PCA is to significantly reduce the number of features, we want to use the smallest number of principal components possible to explain most of the variability. In other words, we would like to use the smallest number of principal components required to get a _good_ understanding of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single or simple answer to answer this question. One way to determine the components required is to visualize the data by examining a _screen plot_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to explain a good amount of variation of the dataset, we can look at the plot and look for a point at which the proportion of variance explained by each subsequent principal component dropss off. This point is often refered to as an elbow because of the bent shape."
