    "\n",
    "Familiarizing myself with methods to handle unbalanced data with Python then build a binary classification model to predict credit card frauds. It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase, and I actually had some fraud purchases happen not too long ago on myself as well but it was not flagged by the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal here is to review methods in the preprocessing/cleaning data, unbalanced dataset solutions for modleing, and review the classification process.\n",

    "\n",
    "The data comes from the [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset on Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Since this is a binary classification problem, we will start our baseline model using a logistic regression algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation method will be the AUPRC score which is the recommended method. AUPRC is the area under the curve where X is recall and Y is precision. This is a better measure to seek a balance between precision and recall vs. accuracy especially when there there is a higher risk in misclassifying a purchase as the bank's risk is a lot higher when it is not classified correctly or on time. Precision-Recall curves also should be used when there is a moderate to large class imbalance\n",

    "\n",
    "- TP - correct positive prediction\n",
    "- TN - correct negative prediction\n",
    "- FP - Type I Error (case negative but predicted positive)\n",
    "- FN - Type II Error (case positive but predicted negative)\n",
    "- Precision - how accurate is the model of those predicted positive that are actually positive\n",
    "    - TP/(TP + FP)\n",
    "- Recall / Sensitivity / TPR (True Positive Rate) - how many actual positives the model labeled over the total positives\n",
    "    - TP/(TP + FN) which is also TP/All P\n",
    "- Specificity (True Negative Rate) - number of correct negative predictions\n",
    "    - TN/(TN + FP) which is also TN/All N\n",
    "- F1 Score - weighted average of TPR (Recall) and Precision, useful if there is uneven class distribution like cancer detection where there can be 10,000 negatives and only 1 positive or if there is a higher risk if false negatives or false positives\n",
    "    - 2 * ( (Pr * Rc) / (Pr + Rc) )\n",

    "You should have pandas functions like .corr(), scatter_matrix() , .hist() and .bar() on the tip of your tongue. You should always be looking for opportunities to visualize your data using PCA or t-SNE, using sklearn's PCA and TSNE functions.\n",

    "Feature selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "90% of the time, your dataset will have way more features than you need (which leads to excessive training time, and a heightened risk of overfitting). Get familiar with basic filter methods (look up scikit-learn‚Äôs VarianceThreshold and SelectKBest functions), and more sophisticated model-based feature selection methods (look up SelectFromModel).\n",

    "You definitely should know what GridSearchCV does and how it works. Likewise for RandomSearchCV. To really stand out, try experimenting with skopt's BayesSearchCV to learn how you can apply bayesian optimization to your hyperparameter search.\n",

    "Use sklearn's pipeline library to wrap their preprocessing, feature selection and modeling steps together. Discomfort with pipeline is a huge tell that a data scientist needs to get more familiar with their modeling toolkit."
