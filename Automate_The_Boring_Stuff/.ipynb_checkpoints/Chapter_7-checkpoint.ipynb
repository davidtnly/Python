Any other string would not match the \\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d \\d\\d regex.\n",

    "Whenever you’re tackling a new project, it can be tempting to dive right into writing code. But more often than not, it’s best to take a step back and consider the bigger picture. I recommend first drawing up a high-level plan for what your program needs to do. Don’t think about the actual code yet—you can worry about that later. Right now, stick to broad strokes.\n",

    "Create two regexes, one for matching phone numbers and the other for matching email addresses.\n",

    "This list is like a road map for the project. As you write the code, you can focus on each of these steps separately. Each step is fairly manageable and expressed in terms of things you already know how to do in Python."
